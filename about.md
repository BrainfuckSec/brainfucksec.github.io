### About Me

I am a Hacker, not for skills, I definitely have a long way to go, but I am a Hacker because I try to understand how things work, and I try to improve them, whether it is an operating system, a program or an object that I use everyday.

I use almost exclusively GNU/Linux Operating Systems, I have been an Arch Linux user for about 5 years and I try to contribute as much as I can to this fantastic community, Arch Linux philosophy has led me to apply the KISS principle in programming and in problem solving, simple concept but complex to master.
I use Kali Linux for pentesting, another project I've been following for a long time, an ever-present distro in my machines, the transition to rolling distro and the latest improvements are great, anyway,these days I'm testing a new setup for pentesting with BlackArch, more precisely Arch Linux with BlackArch repositories, a configuration that convinced me and I think I'll use it for a long time.

Since 3 years my studies are mainly about Networking, I have a particular interest in alternative and decentralized networks such as Tor and P2P networks, because I think that the Internet as we know it today is no longer sustainable and we need an alternative solution.
I'm a supporter of Free Open Source Software, of course there are exceptions, but the basic concept is that if you can't read the code of an application, you can't know what it really does once started.
As for the rest, being a Hacker, anything about 0 and 1 catches my attention.
