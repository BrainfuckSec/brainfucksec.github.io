### About Me

I am a Hacker, not for skills, I definitely have a long way to go, but I am a Hacker because I try to understand how things work, and I try to improve them, whether it is an operating system, a program or an object that I usually use.
This not only for the technical things but also for the world around me, yes, sometimes it's very exhausting, but nothing is achieved without sacrifice and devotion.
I opened a door and decided to go through it, and now I don't want and I can't go back, knowledge is power but it has a price, a price that I'm gladly to pay.

About technology, I use almost exclusively Gnu/Linux operating systems, I have been an Arch Linux user for about 5 years and I try to contribute as much as I can to this fantastic community, Arch Linux philosophy has led me to apply the KISS principle in programming and Occam's razor principle in problem solving, as simple as complex to master.
I use Kali Linux for pentesting, another project I've been following for a long time, an ever-present distro in my machines, the transition to rolling distro and the latest improvements are great.

Since 3 years my studies are mainly about Networking, I have a particular interest in alternative and decentralized networks such as Tor and P2P networks, because I think that the Internet as we know it today is no longer sustainable and we need an alternative solution.
I'm a supporter of Free Open Source Software, of course there are exceptions but the basic concept is that if you can't read the code of an application you can't know how it behaves once started.
As for the rest, being a Hacker, anything about a 0 and a 1 catches my attention.
